# Equipment-Reservation-And-Borrowing-System
The new equipment reservation and borrowing system should be implemented where the system provides
inventory management, equipment borrowing, monitoring, tracking and reporting features. This system will
be a web-based system with a user-friendly GUI to support Senior Technician (Administrator), Technician
and Student. Their usages of the system are identified as follows:

• Student: equipment reservation, check personal borrowing records\
• Technician: inventory management, handle check-in/out of equipment, lookup overdue items\
• Senior Technician: check the analytic & report, account management
